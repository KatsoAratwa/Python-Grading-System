# Python-Grading-System
I was tasked with craeting a grading system that kept being developed over the weeks. I took 7 weeks to create it. This system managed a variety on tasks through the use of sections. My code is simple to understand and the program itself is user frriendly.  

This is what each section is able to do:
Section A
1. It asks students to enter their Names, Surname and their marks out of 100. (I used a loop to handle multiple students)
2. It represents the marks that each student got in te form of a Grade  
3. It creates a Class summary that shows the total number of students, how many failed or passed and gives a class average.

Section B
1. It enters the marks of a student from different subjects that are Math, English and Science
2. It stores the grades in a list and combines the student's name using a tuple.
3. It calculates and displays the average of each student.
4. It creates a Subject statistic that shows the highest and lowest grade for each subject.

Section C
1. It uses dictionaries as the key: values being Student:Grades
2. It displays a main menu that uses functions to add,update,remove, view and search for students.
3. The add_student function is the most important. If you want to update,view or search for a student they have to be added into the program first. I created a loop that prompts a user to add a student first if they are not in the program yet.

Section D
1. It modularized the functions
2. Each function uses the try-except blocks to catch invalid inputs and displays clear messages.

Section E
1. It has 2 classes called Student and Gradebook that reaplace the global dictionaries and functions used in the previous sections.
2. There is a new function that sorts students. It sorts students by average(highest to lowest), name(alphabetical order) and by subject(highest to lowest in every subject).

Section F
1.
